        &nbsp;&nbsp; It is never an easy decision to travel overseas for medical
        treatment – there are many factors involved that need thorough planning.
        It is also common to worry about the logistics when you finally arrive
        at the hospital. How will you communicate with staff in a foreign
        country? How will you know where to go? What if it takes longer than
        expected and my visa runs out – will I be put on a plane back home
        without receiving all the medical attention I need?
